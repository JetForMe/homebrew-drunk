# homebrew-drunk

This is a Tap of random, misc, useful and less useful [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) formulae.

## How-to

Precondition for everything is to have Homebrew installed: `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"`
At this point, in order to install one of the formulae in this tap, you can either:

* install with a direct URL: `brew install git@github.com:michelangelo/homebrew-drunk.git/someformula.rb`

* add this whole tap to your homebrew installation: `brew tap git@github.com:michelangelo/homebrew-drunk.git` and then install what you need as usual.

## More information

This is not rocket science at all, Homebrew is a wonderfully crafted piece of software. Just go to their [wiki](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki) for more detailed information.

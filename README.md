# homebrew-drunk

This is a tap of random, misc, useful and less useful [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) formulae.

## How-to

If you don't have Homebrew already installed go shamefully on their homepage and install it. Seriously, it's incredibly simple.
Once you've done that, just add this tap to your installation: `brew tap michelangelo/homebrew-drunk`

## More information

This is not rocket science at all, Homebrew is a wonderfully crafted piece of software. Just go to their [wiki](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki) for more detailed information.

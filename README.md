# homebrew-drunk

This is a tap of random, misc, useful and less useful [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) formulae.

## How-to

If you don't have Homebrew already installed go shamefully on their homepage and install it. Seriously, it's incredibly simple.
Once you've done that, just `brew tap michelangelo/homebrew-drunk` and `brew install <formula>`.

Alternatively, you are free to install individual formulae directly: `brew install https://raw.github.com/michelangelo/homebrew-drunk/<formula>.rb`.

## More information

`brew help` and `man brew` are enough in the vast majority of cases.

This is not rocket science at all, Homebrew is a wonderfully crafted piece of software. Just go to their [wiki](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki) for more detailed information.
